Crossfilter millions of records without latencies. This project is work in progress and not documented yet. Please get in touch if you have questions.

The largest experiments we have done so far is 10M flights in the browser and ~180M flights or [~1.2B stars](#gaia) when connected to [MapD](https://www.mapd.com/).

## Demos

- 1M flights in the browser: https://uwdata.github.io/falcon/flights/
- 7M flights in [MapD](https://www.mapd.com/): https://uwdata.github.io/falcon/flights-mapd/
- 500k weather records: https://uwdata.github.io/falcon/weather/

## Usage

Install with `yarn add falcon-vis`. You can use two query engines. First `ArrowDB` reading data from [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/). This engine works completely in the browser and scales up to ten million rows. Second, `MapDDB`, which connects to [MapD](http://mapd.com/). The indexes are created as [ndarrays](https://github.com/scijs/ndarray). Check out the examples to see how to set up an app with your own data. More documentation will follow.

## Features

### Zoom

You can zoom histograms. Falcon automatically re-bins the data.

### Show and hide base

The base data, which are the original counts without filters, can be displayed behind the filtered counts to provide context. Hiding the base shows the relative distribution of the data.

With base.

Without base.

### Circles or Color Heatmap

Heatmap with circles (default). Can show the base (data without filters).

## Falcon with 1.2 billion stars from the GAIA dataset

The [GAIA spacecraft](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)>) measured the positions and distances of stars with unprecedented precision. It collected about 1 billion objects, mainly stars, but also planets, comets, asteroids and quasars among others. Below, we show the dataset loaded in Falcon (with MapD).

## Developers

Install the dependencies with `yarn`. Then run `yarn start` to start the flight demo with in memory data. Have a look at the other `script` commands in [`package.json`](https://github.com/uwdata/falcon/blob/master/package.json).

## Experiments

First version that turned out to be too complicated is at https://github.com/uwdata/falcon/tree/complex and the client-server version is at https://github.com/uwdata/falcon/tree/client-server.
